# Diffraction Pattern Python Analysis

## About Analysis
This project builds fundamental and repeatable applications for diffraction pattern analysis. 
The functions created can be extended to different datasets with easy adjustments.

Very grateful to Tom Wood for his infinite coding knowledge and his numpy tutorials which were used as a basis for this project. https://github.com/tom-wood/numpy-tutorials

## Deployment
To explore this analysis, first download the ZnO.xye file and any of the python files you wish to view into the same folder. 
The python files can then by loaded in Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook.
